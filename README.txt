== Description ==

Shin's Pageload Magic is a lightweight Wordpress plugin that dramatically boosts your page's rendering speed. It's very amazing!

= Case Study =

Techsignin.com is a technology news site in Vietnam with a relatively high pageview rate. Before I applied this acceleration method, it took over 20 seconds to start rendering the interface, even on the mobile web.

By default, CSS is treated as a render blocking resource, which means that the browser won't render any processed content until the CSSOM is constructed.

That was a big deal, because it diminished potential users as well as reduced page views. While reviewing the site's waterfall charts, in that night I applied this acceleration method, as it consumes the least amount of time and cost. Now the site is rendered much faster. The website owner is also very satisfied.

Make sure to keep your CSS lean, deliver it as quickly as possible, and use media types and queries to unblock rendering.
